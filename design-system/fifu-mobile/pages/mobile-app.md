# Fifu Mobile App Overrides

These rules override design-system/fifu-mobile/MASTER.md for the mobile app UI.

## Typography
- Heading font: Space Grotesk
- Body font: Inter
- Rationale: Space Grotesk adds character while keeping readability. Inter remains neutral for dense lists.

## Color Adjustments
- Background: #FDF2F3
- Surface: #FFF9FA
- Text: #3A0B14
- Muted text: #7A3A46
- Primary, Secondary, CTA: keep MASTER values

## Style Notes
- Keep bold minimalism but prioritize utility and scannability over oversized type.
- Avoid heavy shadows. Use 1px borders and soft elevation only on primary cards.
- Use iconography from Lucide only. No emoji icons in UI.

## Navigation
- Bottom tabs: Home, Downloads, Library, Settings.
- Use a sticky primary action button only on Options and Downloads screens.
