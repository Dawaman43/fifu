# Configuration & data

Fifu stores lightweight local data so you can resume your workflow quickly.

## History and favorites

History and favorites are stored in:

`~/.config/fifu/data.json`

- History keeps the 10 most recent searches.
- Favorites store the channel metadata needed to re-open a channel quickly.

## Clearing history

To clear history, remove the `history` array from `data.json` or delete the file entirely. Fifu will recreate it on next launch.

## Reset everything

Delete `~/.config/fifu/data.json` to reset both history and favorites. The file will be re-created automatically.
