# Downloads & files

## Download path

Fifu saves downloads to:

`~/Downloads/videos/<channel-name>/`

Each channel gets its own folder. Fifu sanitizes channel names so they are valid folder names on every OS.

## Duplicate handling

Before a queue starts, Fifu checks the output folder and skips videos with the same title. This makes reruns safe and fast.

## File formats

- Video downloads are merged into MP4 when possible.
- Audio-only downloads are saved using the best available audio format.

## Logs

A downloader log is written to:

`~/.config/fifu/downloader.log`

Use this file if you need to diagnose failed downloads or report a bug.
