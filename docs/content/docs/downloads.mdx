# Downloads & files

## Download path

Fifu saves downloads to:

`~/Downloads/videos/<channel-name>/`

When downloading a **playlist**, it creates a subfolder:

`~/Downloads/videos/<channel-name>/<playlist-name>/`

Fifu sanitizes names so they are valid folder names on every OS.

## Duplicate handling

Before a queue starts, Fifu checks the output folder and skips videos that have already been fully downloaded (comparing both titles and IDs). This makes reruns safe and fast.

## File formats

- Video downloads are merged into MP4 when possible.
- Audio-only downloads are saved using the best available audio format.

## Logs

A downloader log is written to:

`~/.config/fifu/downloader.log`

Use this file if you need to diagnose failed downloads or report a bug.
