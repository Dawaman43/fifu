# FAQ

## Can I download a full channel?

Yes. Search for a channel, select it, and set the number of videos to download. Fifu will queue that many recent uploads.

## Can I download a playlist only?

Yes. Paste a playlist URL on the search screen to go straight to options for that playlist.

## Where do files go?

By default, downloads are saved to `~/Downloads/videos/<channel-name>/`.

## How does Fifu avoid duplicates?

Fifu compares file titles in the output folder before starting the queue and skips matches.

## Does Fifu need ffmpeg?

`ffmpeg` is optional but recommended. It allows `yt-dlp` to merge separate audio and video streams when needed.

## Where is my history saved?

History and favorites are stored in `~/.config/fifu/data.json`.
