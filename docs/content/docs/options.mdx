# Download options

Fifu keeps the options screen simple so you can queue downloads fast.

## Video count

Choose how many videos to download from the selected channel or playlist. The app loads metadata first so you know what will be queued.

## Quality presets

- Best quality
- 1080p
- 720p
- 480p
- Audio only

The best quality preset prioritizes MP4 formats when possible and falls back safely if a specific resolution is unavailable.

## Playlists

If a channel has playlists or sections, you can download a specific playlist instead of the full channel feed. The first option is always the channel's default videos.

## Subtitles

Enable **Download & Embed Subtitles** to fetch available subtitles and embed them in the final file. If multiple languages are available, Fifu will attempt to download the best match automatically.
