# Quickstart

Use this flow if you want results immediately.

1. Start the app with `fifu` or `npx fifu-tui`.
2. Type a channel name in the search bar, then press Enter.
3. Choose the channel from the results list.
4. Pick the number of videos, quality preset, and whether to embed subtitles.
5. Press **Start Download** to launch the queue.

By default, downloads are saved in `~/Downloads/videos/<channel-name>/`.

## Playlist shortcut

If you already have a playlist URL, paste it into the search field and press Enter. Fifu will skip the channel list and open the options screen for that playlist.
