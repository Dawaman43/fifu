# Troubleshooting

## No videos found

- Confirm the channel has public uploads.
- If you used a playlist URL, verify it is public and not region-restricted.

## Downloads fail instantly

- Check your network connection.
- Ensure `yt-dlp` can access YouTube from your region.
- Review `~/.config/fifu/downloader.log` for the exact error.

## Some files are missing audio or video

Install `ffmpeg` so `yt-dlp` can merge audio and video streams when needed.

## The app exits while downloading

Fifu cancels active downloads when you quit. Let the queue finish or restart later; already-downloaded titles will be skipped.

## Output folder is empty

- Verify you have permission to write to `~/Downloads/videos/`.
- Check the log file for errors during download or merge steps.

## Subtitles did not embed

- Some videos do not have subtitle tracks available.
- If subtitles download separately, make sure `ffmpeg` is installed so embedding can complete.
