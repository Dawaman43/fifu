# UI Tour

Use this guide to understand the purpose of each screen before you run your first queue.

## Search screen

- Search for channels by name.
- Paste a playlist URL to skip search results.
- Use the history and favorites lists to resume previous targets.

## Download options screen

![Download options placeholder](/screenshots/options.svg)

- Decide how many videos to download.
- Pick a quality preset or audio-only.
- Enable subtitles if you need them embedded.
- Optionally pick a playlist from the channel.

## Download queue screen

![Download queue placeholder](/screenshots/download.svg)

- Track overall queue progress.
- See per-video progress and status updates.
- Review the log for completed and skipped downloads.

## Replace these placeholders

The SVGs above are placeholders so the page works immediately. Replace them with real screenshots when ready by saving your images in `docs/public/screenshots/` using the same filenames.
