# Usage

Fifu is organized into four screens: search, channel list, options, and downloads. Each screen is optimized for keyboard flow.

## Search screen

- Enter a channel name to search YouTube.
- Paste a playlist URL to skip search and go straight to options.
- Recent searches appear in the history list.
- Favorites appear in the favorites list.

## Channel list

- Select a channel to open download options.
- Press `f` to toggle favorites for a channel.
- Press `Escape` to return to search.

## Download options

- Choose how many videos to download.
- Pick a quality preset or audio-only.
- Select a playlist or section if the channel exposes playlists.
- Toggle subtitle download and embedding.

## Download screen

- Fifu downloads up to three videos concurrently.
- Live progress shows per-video status and overall queue progress.
- Already-downloaded titles are skipped based on the output folder.

## Keyboard-first flow

You can complete the entire flow without touching the mouse. The `Enter` key confirms selections and starts the queue.
