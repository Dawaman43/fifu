# Workflow

Use this page as the full mental model for how Fifu operates.

## 1. Launch

Run `fifu` or `npx fifu-tui` and wait for the search screen to load.

## 2. Search or paste

- Search by channel name and press Enter.
- Or paste a playlist URL to skip search and go straight to options.

## 3. Choose a target

Pick the channel you want from the results list. If the channel exposes playlists or sections, you can optionally target those in the options screen.

## 4. Configure downloads

- Select the number of videos to download.
- Pick a quality preset or audio-only mode.
- Toggle subtitle download and embedding.

## 5. Run the queue

The download screen shows live progress for each active download. Fifu processes up to three videos at a time.

## 6. Re-run safely

Re-running the same channel or playlist is safe. Fifu checks the output folder and skips titles that already exist.
